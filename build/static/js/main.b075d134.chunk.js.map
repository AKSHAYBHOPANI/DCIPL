How would this\r\n          impact her position? The £12,000 net paid would attract tax relief at\r\n          source of 20%, increasing the amount invested to £15,000. Gill's\r\n          adjusted net income would reduce by £15,000, and would allow her to\r\n          reclaim her full personal allowance, reducing her self-assessment\r\n          balancing payment by £3,000. Gill would be able to reclaim a further\r\n          £3,000 tax relief, as the payment to the pension would qualify for tax\r\n          relief at her highest rate paid (40%), of which she only received 20%\r\n          relief at source. Another way of looking at it would be that Gill\r\n          would get a £15,000 investment in her pension for a net cost to her of\r\n          £6,000.\r\n        </span>\r\n        {/*Estate planning*/}\r\n        <div class=\"start3\">\r\n          <div class=\"box5\"></div>\r\n          <span class=\"heading2\">Estate Planning</span>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className=\"pic17\">\r\n          <img src={pic17} alt=\"\" />\r\n        </div>\r\n        <span class=\"subhead7\">\r\n          Estate Planning is not only for the Rich and the Old.

Or we are asked if we can just arrange a specific transaction, for example a pension transfer because that’s all that someone needs, all their other finances are in order, they just need that one thing sorting out.\r\n                The short answer is that we don’t offer this kind of “execution only” service.\r\n                The key point is that the Financial Advisor does not give advice about the investment and so doesn’t need to consider whether its appropriate. In other words, they don’t have to find out anything about the client’s circumstances.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"serpcolumn serpright\">\r\n

We have robust and scalable multi-level architecture using the most secure services of AWS. Our infrastructure strictly follows the AWS Well-Architected Framework, making stack most secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient.\r\n            All of our servers are kept under Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and environments are isolated using sub-netting. The servers are physically located in the AWS Asia Pacific Region (India).\r\n            We have a ‘Network and Application Firewall’ in place and have implemented industry best practices like OWASP guidelines to make it secure. We have also deployed the latest version of ModSecurity on Web Application Firewall, to mitigate new immersing attacks on public applications.\r\n            Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks are prevented using the multi-level defence firewalls.\r\n            <h3>Data Security:</h3>\r\n            All users' data is managed in the encrypted format at all times. This encryption on data is applied at both in-transit and in-rest.\r\n            The transmission of data is encrypted by a bank-grade TLS encryption algorithm, which helps in protecting users' data from Man-in-the-middle and eavesdropping attacks.\r\n            At the data storage level, we are conscious of data atomicity, data consistency, data integrity, and durability of the data. We have also enabled activity logging and auditing for swift intrusion detection into the system. We utilise data replication for data resiliency and disaster recovery as well as backup testing for data reliability.\r\n            Additionally, multi-level role-based access control is implemented to secure users' data. Internally, we limit the access of development server through bundling identity management and secured multi-tunnel private VPN channels.\r\n            Fore more information, please check the privacy policy.\r\n            <h3>Application Security:</h3>\r\n            We have implemented strict password policy and a mandatory Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) protocol for user login.
