How would this\n        impact her position? The £12,000 net paid would attract tax relief at\n        source of 20%, increasing the amount invested to £15,000. Gill's\n        adjusted net income would reduce by £15,000, and would allow her to\n        reclaim her full personal allowance, reducing her self-assessment\n        balancing payment by £3,000. Gill would be able to reclaim a further\n        £3,000 tax relief, as the payment to the pension would qualify for tax\n        relief at her highest rate paid (40%), of which she only received 20%\n        relief at source. Another way of looking at it would be that Gill would\n        get a £15,000 investment in her pension for a net cost to her of £6,000.\n      </span>\n      {/*Estate planning*/}\n      <div class=\"start3\">\n        <div class=\"box5\"></div>\n        <span class=\"heading2\">Estate Planning</span>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"pic17\">\n        <img src={pic17} alt=\"\" />\n      </div>\n      <span class=\"subhead7\">\n        Estate Planning is not only for the Rich and the Old.
