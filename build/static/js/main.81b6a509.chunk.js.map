How would this\n          impact her position? The £12,000 net paid would attract tax relief at\n          source of 20%, increasing the amount invested to £15,000. Gill's\n          adjusted net income would reduce by £15,000, and would allow her to\n          reclaim her full personal allowance, reducing her self-assessment\n          balancing payment by £3,000. Gill would be able to reclaim a further\n          £3,000 tax relief, as the payment to the pension would qualify for tax\n          relief at her highest rate paid (40%), of which she only received 20%\n          relief at source. Another way of looking at it would be that Gill\n          would get a £15,000 investment in her pension for a net cost to her of\n          £6,000.\n        </span>\n        {/*Estate planning*/}\n        <div class=\"start3\">\n          <div class=\"box5\"></div>\n          <span class=\"heading2\">Estate Planning</span>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pic17\">\n          <img src={pic17} alt=\"\" />\n        </div>\n        <span class=\"subhead7\">\n          Estate Planning is not only for the Rich and the Old.
