        Gill could make a pension contribution of £12,000 before 6 April 2020
        from her savings to her group personal pension plan. How would this
        impact her position? The £12,000 net paid would attract tax relief at
        source of 20%, increasing the amount invested to £15,000. Gill's
        adjusted net income would reduce by £15,000, and would allow her to
        reclaim her full personal allowance, reducing her self-assessment
        balancing payment by £3,000. Gill would be able to reclaim a further
        £3,000 tax relief, as the payment to the pension would qualify for tax
        relief at her highest rate paid (40%), of which she only received 20%
        relief at source. Another way of looking at it would be that Gill would
        get a £15,000 investment in her pension for a net cost to her of £6,000.

        People are under a delusion when it comes to estate planning – that's

        Estate planning in simple terms refers to the passing assets /
        investments down from one generation to another. You decide how much of
        your estate – be it property(s), car(s), personal accolades, financial
        investments, etc. – you want to pass on to whom and how, after your
        demise. It is a dynamic process that needs to be reviewed at regular
        intervals to absorb any changes that might happen in our life or in the
        laws of the country.

        provenance; if he/she meets the desirable qualities. The qualities of an
        estate planner cannot be judged in a single meeting, but spread over
        several initial meetings. During these meetings, you ought to deeply
